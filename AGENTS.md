# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI agents working on this codebase.

## Architecture Overview

- `src/cli.ts` is the entrypoint. It wires commands with `commander` and dispatches into `src/commands/*`.
- `src/services/scanner.ts` scans repositories, detects context files, and validates references.
- `src/services/scorer.ts` computes the maturity score and recommendations.
- `src/models/patterns.ts` defines the file detection patterns and weights.
- The `dist/` directory is the compiled output generated by `npm run build`.

## Key Files

- `src/cli.ts` - CLI wiring and command registration.
- `src/commands/scan.ts` - Terminal/markdown/json/csv/sarif scan output.
- `src/commands/report.ts` - Report output for `context-frame report`.
- `src/services/scanner.ts` - File discovery, metrics, and reference validation.
- `src/services/scorer.ts` - Scoring model and recommendations.
- `src/models/patterns.ts` - Pattern definitions for supported tools.

## Coding Standards

- TypeScript first; keep changes in `src/` and rebuild instead of editing `dist/` by hand.
- Prefer ASCII in CLI output (no emoji) to avoid Windows terminal encoding issues.
- Match existing style: semicolons, single quotes, and small helper functions.
- Keep output changes in sync with `README.md` examples when applicable.

## Run and Test

- Build: `npm run build`
- Dev run: `npm run dev`
- CLI (built): `npm start` or `node dist/cli.js scan .`
- Tests: none currently defined.
